# Portfolio Project: Next.js VENDAARLIA
____
Introduction
Vendaarlia's Everything and Anything Guild is a portfolio website creation project that offers the unique experience of exploring a world of dungeons and parties controlled by a group of maniac scientists. Each page on this website represents part of a guild whose purpose is to manage a dungeon and party, with users identified as "travelers".

Built using Next.js technology, this project is a collaboration between mad scientists with extreme design and programming skills to achieve unique results that are different from other portfolio websites.

In the user's experience, each website page represents a room or part of a dungeon managed by a guild. Users are invited to explore each room and discover the creative works produced by the guild. Each piece has a strange and unique feel, reflecting design and programming experiments carried out by maniacal scientists.

As such, Vendaarlia's Everything and Anything Guild offers an engaging and entertaining experience for its visitors, while showcasing the creative portfolio of a talented group of mad scientists in design and programming.

## Overview

This repository serves as a showcase of my work in frontend development using Next.js.

## Here's a brief overview:

#### Pages: Contains the different pages of my portfolio website.
#### Components: Reusable components used throughout the website.
#### Public: Assets such as images and fonts.
#### Styles: CSS stylesheets for styling components.

## Technologies Used

#### Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
#### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
#### CSS: Styling language for designing the look and feel of the website.

## Usage
### To view the portfolio website locally:

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
