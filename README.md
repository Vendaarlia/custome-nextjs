# Portfolio Project: Next.js VENDAARLIA
____
Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio project! I'm a self-taught frontend developer with a background in graphic design. My educational journey in graphic design has equipped me with a deep understanding of visual attraction and best practices. Through my studies, I've honed my visual sense, perspective, and explored various visual concepts, influencing my approach to frontend development.

## Overview

This repository serves as a showcase of my work in frontend development using Next.js.

## Here's a brief overview:

#### Pages: Contains the different pages of my portfolio website.
#### Components: Reusable components used throughout the website.
#### Public: Assets such as images and fonts.
#### Styles: CSS stylesheets for styling components.

## Technologies Used

#### Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
#### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
#### CSS: Styling language for designing the look and feel of the website.

## Usage
### To view the portfolio website locally:

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Credits
